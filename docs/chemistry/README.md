# Chemistry
Often regarded as "the central science", the study of chemistry overlaps with a number of disciplines including, but not limited to biology, physics, mathematics and electrical engineering.

It primarily focuses on the study of matter; how and why substances interact with their environment. 
The rules that govern chemical processes often change substantially depending on the state (solid, liquid, gas) of the matter in question.
As such, the following sections are subdivided according to these states

## The Solid State

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| [Special Quasi-Random Structures](special_quasi_random_structures.md) | Using sufficently randomised crystal stuctures to estimate the properties of alloys.

## The Liquid State

## The Gas State
