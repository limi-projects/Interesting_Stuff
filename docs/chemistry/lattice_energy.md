The <ins>lattice energy</ins> is the difference in potential energy between ions in the solid state and the gaseous state.

Consequently, the lattice energy is always positive because bonds are being broken.

A large lattice energy indicates a strongly bound solid becuase more energy is needed to vaporise the solid.

The <ins>lattice enthalpy</ins> is the standard molar enthalpy change for:

$AB_{(s)} \rightarrow A_{(g)}^{+}B_{(g)}^{-}$

The lattice energy is equal to the lattice enethalpy when $T=0$. 
However, the difference between the two above $T=0$ is usuallly negligibly small.

The lattice enthalpy can be predicted <ins>for ionic solids</ins> by the Born-Mayer equation and can be experimentally obtained via the Born-Haber cycle.
