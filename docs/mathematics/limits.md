# Limits
A limit is the limiting value that a function approaches.
For example, the limit of ${\frac{1}{x}}$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$ is 0. 

$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0$

This can be visualised by loking at a graph of ${\frac{1}{x}}$, but in many other cases, it may be harder to discern the limiting value.
