# Probability 

## Definitions 
- Experiment: A test (i.e. a single coin flip).
- Trial: A set of experiments.
- Sample space: A set of all possible outcomes.
- Event: A set of possible outcomes that is a subset of the sample space.
- Cardinality: Number of elements in a set.
- Uniform distribution: Each outcome in the sample space is equally likely to occur.

## Probability of a single event occurring
Thus, for a uniform distribution:

$\text{Probability of a specific event} = \frac{\text{Cardinality of the event}}{\text{Cardinality of the set}} \qquad \text{or} \qquad P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}$

If $P(E) = 1$, the occurence of event E is certain. If $P(E) = 0$, the occurence of event E is impossible.
