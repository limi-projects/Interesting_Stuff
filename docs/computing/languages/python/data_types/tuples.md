# Tuples
Tuples are _immutable_ lists. Immutable means that the values within cannot be changed.
Because they are immutable, tuples are slightly more efficient to process than lists.
Tuples are defined using parentheses. 
Only the <ins>entire</ins> tuple can be redefined via a variable. Individual elements within the tuple cannot be redefined.
```python
characters = ("tinker", "tailor", "soldier", "sailor", "rich man", "poor man", "beggar man", "thief",)
print(characters)
characters = ("doctor", "lawyer", "indian chief")
print(characters)
```
> ('tinker', 'tailor', 'soldier', 'sailor', 'rich man', 'poor man', 'beggar man', 'thief')\
> ('doctor', 'lawyer', 'indian chief')
